EverTex Greasemonkey script version 1.1
EverTex Chrome Extension version 1.0 
---------------

EverTex is a Chrome/Firefox extension that shows LaTeX formulas in EverNote's web interface using MathJax. 

*ATTENTION*
Due to some bugs, the current Chrome version of EverTex does *NOT* work. The Greasemonkey version works well in Firefox.

The Greasemonkey script for Firefox is also available at:
http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/122150

A recent version of Firefox is required.  EverTex does not work under Firefox 3.6.10.

With EverTex you can write formulas with MathJax grammar in EverNote webpage's WYSIWYG editor and preview them in the mathematical way.

Just like MathJax, the formulas should be surrounded by $$...$$, \[...\], and \(...\) to be properly rendered.

For more information you can refer to MathJax's webpage (wwww.mathjax.org).
