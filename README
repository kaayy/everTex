EverTex is a Chrome extension that shows LaTeX formulas in EverNote's web interface using MathJax. 

With EverTex you can write formulas with MathJax grammar in EverNote webpage's WYSIWYG editor and preview them in the mathematical way.

Just like MathJax, the formulas should be surrounded by $$...$$, \[...\], and \(...\) to be properly rendered.

For more information you can refer to MathJax's webpage (wwww.mathjax.org).
